         <p><br>Gaming room lights provide good lighting and ambiance for spaces
            <br>in which you and some guests are playing video games or table</br>
            <br>games. At BlissLights, we think of gaming room lights as proper</br>
            <br>lighting for both lengthy video gaming sessions – those nights</br>
            <br>when you’re by yourself but playing role-playing games (RPGs)</br>
            <br>with friends online – and in-person pool or ping-pong night</br></p>
            <p>Price of Lightes<span style="color:red;"> Rs 1500</span></p>
